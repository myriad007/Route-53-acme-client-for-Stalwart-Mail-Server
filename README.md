# 📬 Route 53 ACME Client for Stalwart Mail

A lightweight, automation‑friendly ACME client that issues and deploys TLS certificates via Route 53 DNS‑01 challenges for Stalwart Mail.  
This project fills the gap while native Route 53 support is pending in Stalwart.

## 🧩 Why This Exists
- Stalwart Mail currently lacks native integration with AWS Route 53 for ACME DNS‑01 challenges.  
- This client automates:  
  - Certificate issuance via acme.sh  
  - DNS validation using Route 53  
  - Deployment of certificates to Stalwart Mail’s expected paths  
  - Filtering to only deploy certs for mail* domains  
  - Safe renewal via cron or container entrypoint  

## 🚀 Quick Start
- Clone the repo:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/route53-acme-client.git
  cd route53-acme-client
